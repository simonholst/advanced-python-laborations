Hi! Looks like you managed to complete the task but running visualization.py using Python 3.10 doesn't work on my system..

The structure of your submission is quite different from the lab description, which makes it time consuming to troubleshoot so I suggest that you come to a lab supervision and check with me or Arianna to make sure that it runs.
